I love you California . . . you're the greatest state of all . . .
I love you in the winter, summer, spring, and in the fall.
I love your fertile valleys, your dear mountains I adore.
I love your grand old ocean and I love her rugged shore.

CHORUS

When the snow crowned Golden Sierras, Keep their watch o'er the valleys bloom.
It is there I would be in our land by the sea, Every breeze bearing rich perfume.
It is here nature gives of her rarest. It is Home Sweet Home to me.
And I know when I die I shall breathe my last sigh, For my sunny California.

I love your redwood forests - love your fields of yellow grain.
I love your summer breezes, and I love your winter rain.
I love you, land of flowers; land of honey, fruit and wine.
I love you, California; you have won this heart of mine.

I love your old gray Missions - love your vineyards stretching far.
I love you, California, with your Golden Gate ajar.
I love your purple sunsets, love your skies of azure blue.
I love you, California; I just can't help loving you.

I love you, Catalina - you are very dear to me.
I love you, Tamalpais, and I love Yosemite.
I love you, Land of Sunshine.
Half your beauties are untold.
I loved you in my childhood, and I'll love you when I'm old.
